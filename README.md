# Map-Elites based Hyper Heuristic for RCPSP
**Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites** (MAP-Elites) is a **quality diversity** based algorithm which constructs an archive of solution based on genotypic and phenotypic features of an individual.

In this project we explore the automated evolution of priority rules for generating schedules for the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem(RCPSP).

We provide the comparision between two methods Genetic Programming based Hyper-Heuristic(**GPHH**) and MAP-Elites based Hyper-Heuristic(**MEHH**) and demonstrate the strong improvements in diversity and performance shown by MAP-Elites over the traditional GP based approach. We also compare different archive sizes used for MAP-Elites(125, 1000, 3375 and 8000) and show the variation of coverage and performance for these sizes.


# Dataset
The repo uses 5 datasets `j30`, `j60`, `j90`, `j120`, `RG300` each having instances with the corresponding number of activities suggested by the name.

The **training dataset** consists of `j30` instances only, we validate the solutions generated by the training process on a **validation set** composed of _10%_ of `RG300` set and pick the best individual to be tested on the **test set** which comprises the remaining _90%_ of test set.

# Requirements

# Usage
To run the GPHH experiment :
1. Remove the `logs/gp` folder (Will clear existing results)
2. Update the required parameters for the experiment in `params_gp.py`
3. Run using `python3 params_gp.py`
4. The process will automatically be parallelised on all the available CPU cores
5. After the evolving and evaluation completes the results will be available in `logs/gp/set_0`

To run the MEHH experiment :
1. Remove the `logs/map_elites` folder (Will clear existing results)
2. Update the required parameters for the experiment in `params_map_elites.py`
3. Run using `python3 params_map_elites.py`
4. The process will automatically be parallelised on all the available CPU cores
5. After the evolving and evaluation completes the results will be available in `logs/map_elites/set_0`

To evaluate results : 
1. The `analysis` folder contains various files to evaluate the generated results and plot graphs
2. Ensure the logs folder is present
3. Run any script using `python3`



The [`instance`](./instance.py) file implements code for basic parsing, scheduling algorithm and priority rules. Running it would generate a table of deviation and makespan values for all the different human designed rules such as LFT, LST, FIFO, etc.



The `analysis` folder contains all the scripts used to analse, plot, generate results

The `logs` folder contains all the results after running both GP and MAP-Elites for 31 runs and 25 generations each

The `precomputes` folder acts as cache for speeding up certain calculations
